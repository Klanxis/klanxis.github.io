be fair, the majority of Roblox users are all children and we know how edgy they can be, so non of the offensive and sexually explicit behavior is surprising. That a child-dominated space attracts predators is also natural. To solve this I suggest we get rid of children.

That companies just say “AI” and “Large Language Model” to convince everyone with a surface level knowledge of these things to address possible points of contention is going to be the industry standard for the foreseeable future, while anyone could probably create a “R4pe 4ll N1gg3rs”-mod in the next five minutes and get away with it, for we as mankind have absolutely no way to deal with infractions like this aside from outright squashing every attempt at human-user created freedom. There are text-censorship systems in games that prevent me from naming my load-out with my trusty M4 assault rifle in Call of Duty “ Assault” for it has the word “Ass” in it and that just isn’t acceptable language in my mass-murder simulator.

The opposite of (anarchistic) freedom is oppression and tribalism has caused people in internet discourse to only take either stance on this in reality incredibly wide spectrum.

Roblox has already won, money has been made, a more noble agenda was never pursued and if Hindenburg dealt a fatal wound, which it seems they haven’t so far, good riddance. In its place, another will rise.</body></div>
