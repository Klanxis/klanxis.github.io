     <h1>On the Nearctic</h1>

<div class="article">
    As we all know the word arctic means next to the bear, which is why polar bears were allowed to settle there.
<p></p>

For most of known time, the Nearctic
has been a ghastly place, full of ice and empty of warmth.
<p></p>

In all the time that I’ve spent in the Nearctic, I have never ever had any experience.
<p></p>

It is not (fill in adjective in post, don’t publish before) of me to say, that the Nearctic is the most inhospitable place in all of the northern hemisphere, after Russia.
<p></p>

We all know that the word Russia means next to the Rus people, who were from Sweden. And if you’ve ever beheld an Atlas, who was a person that held the UNIVERSE on their shoulders, you would’ve looked at a map of the world and be confused, because it wasn’t a map of the universe.
<p></p>

After your initial shookness, you would then open the page of the Russo-Swedish alliance to see that the two countries are what we call in the biz “touching tips”, which explains the etymology.
<p></p>

Unfortunately, neither Sweden nor Russia nor Rusweden (working title) are in the Nearctic, so none of this matters.
<p></p>

All in all I wouldn’t recommend moving to the Nearctic, because would you rather meet an immigrant or a polar bear in Sweden?
