<!--The Contact Us Page
Your form must include the following fields:
- name (mandatory field)
- address
- mobile (an Irish mobile number)
- email (mandatory field)
- retype your email (mandatory field)
- radio buttons allowing the user to indicate if he/she is a member or non-member
(mandatory field)
- query/comment (mandatory field)
- submit button
Note:
- When the user presses the submit button the form should be sent via the POST
method to a php file(http://rdwd.atspace.cc/response.php).
- Note: Explicit association must be used for form input controls and labels.
- The form input controls must have their name attributes set as follows: name,
address, mobile, email1, email2, member & query.
Validation required:
1. Name, email, retype your email and query/comment fields must contain values
2. The member/non-member radio button set must have one (and only one) option
selected
3. The email field must be validated
4. The two email fields must match
5. The mobile telephone number should begin with either 087, 086 or 085 in the first
three digits and the string should be 10 chars in length
Note: You should use HTML5 attributes to perform as much of the form validation as
possible, e.g. check the required attribute for any form elements that are mandatory.
You should write JavaScript methods to perform additional form validation e.g. mobile
phone validation.-->
